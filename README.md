# AirBnB Clone Project

---

## Project Overview üöÄ

This project aims to develop a comprehensive and scalable backend system for an AirBnB-like booking platform. It's a deep dive into full-stack development, with a primary focus on designing robust backend systems, efficient database architecture, secure API development, and streamlined application deployment. Through this project, we'll simulate real-world development scenarios, understanding complex architectures, collaborative workflows, and team dynamics required to build a scalable web application.
